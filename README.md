### Description

This is Chess game with engine implemented as activeX DLL project. It also displays computer thinkings. It currently thinks 1 level deep, but it could be easily changed (recursive).

Since this project exists for 2 months, it is buggy (engine doesn't have idea about castling; user can castle, also piece promotion is not yet implemeted)and incomplete. I plan to port code (when it'll be ready) to C++.

U will have big problems reading this code. It is very complicated plus comments and variables names are not in english. But on request I can translate at least comments...

User cannot drag pieces; he must type moves instead (like e2e4)...

U can use this code freely!
